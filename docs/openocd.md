### Installation on Ubuntu based distros

```bash
sudo apt install openocd
```

### Installation on Windows
1. Download OpenOCD: Get the latest Windows `.zip` from [xPack OpenOCD](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/releases).
1. Extract & Path: Extract them to `C:\openocd` or suitable alternative location
1. Environment Variables: Add the `bin` folder to your Windows System PATH.

#### Windows Driver
For native Windows OpenOCD to see your ST-Link, you must use the WinUSB driver. Windows defaults to a proprietary ST driver that OpenOCD cannot talk to.

1. Download [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/).
1. Plug in your board. In Zadig, go to Options > List All Devices.
1. Select ST-LINK/V2-1 (Interface 0).
1. Switch the driver to WinUSB and click Replace Driver.

### Running openocd
To run `openocd` with `stlink` using the [command link with no customisation](https://openocd.org/doc-release/html/Running.html#Simple-setup_002c-no-customization)

Connect the `32F429ZI-Discovery` board to the development environment via usb.

```bash
cd my-project

openocd -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/interface/stlink.cfg \
        -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/target/stm32f4x.cfg
```
Windows terminal
```bash
openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32f4x.cfg
```
**Output**
```bash

```

Check for `openocd` ports using `netstat` command. `netstat` is part of the net-tools package.

- [How to Install netstat Command in Linux](https://www.tecmint.com/install-netstat-in-linux/)

```bash
sudo apt install net-tools
```

Check installation
```bash
netstat -v
```

Find `openocd` ports. 

```bash
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep openocd
```

```bash
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:4444          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      2872/openocd        
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:3333          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      2872/openocd        
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:6666          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      2872/openocd   
```

- 4444 is for telnet
- 3333 is for gdb

### Shutting down openocd

Use ctrl + c to invoke the shutdown command.

### gdb-multiarch usage 

On Ubuntu based distros, open new terminal to debug project. Assumes package `gdb-multiarch` installed.

Install `gdb-multiarch` a GNU Debugger (with support for multiple architectures). Alternative [gdb installation options](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/installing-gdb).

```bash
sudo apt install gdb-multiarch
```

```bash
cd my-project
gdb-multiarch ./awesomesauce.elf
```

### arm-none-eabi-gdb usage on Windows
Navigate to your project folder (where your .axf or elf is) and open a command prompt and run:
```dos
arm-none-eabi-gdb .\Objects\binary-name.axf
```

```bash

(gdb) 
```

Connect gdb to the `openocd` port 3333. The program will break at main function start. The attached hardware will be held in a reset state.

At (gdb) prompt type:

```bash
(gdb) target extended-remote localhost:3333
```

```bash
Remote debugging using localhost:3333
main () at my-project.c:17
17				__asm__("nop");
```

Open more debugging terminal pane using `lay next` command
```bash
(gdb) lay next
(gdb) lay next
```

Set break point at main function. Then type c to continue  program.

```bash
(gdb) b main
(gdb) c
```

The program will continue.

Use Ctrl + c keys to exit the running program.

Set another breakpoint at line 20. The `c` to continue.

```bash
(gdb) b 20
(gdb) c
Continuing.
```

step next line
```bash
(gdb) n
(gdb) s
```

Breakpoint 2, main () at my-project.c:20
```

Close panes, click inside pane press
Ctrl + x, Ctrl + a

'''bash
(gdb) info registers
```

```bash
(gdb) focus next
```

### View the gpio register memory address

Use `-g3` when compiling, the compiler then adds macros into debug info.

Then in gdb simply type: 

```bash
(gdb) p /x *GPIOG
```

```bash
(gdb) p /t *GPIOG
```

You also can check if the `.elf` contains the macros, using:

```bash
arm-none-eabi-objdump --dwarf=macro xxxx.elf >xxxx.dwarf
```

### Using a .gdbinit file to auto connect to openocd port

We can add the command:

```bash
target extended-remote localhost:3333
```
to a projects `.gdbinit` file to save typing it at the (gdb) prompt.

Inside the folder that will contain the `.elf` file, create file `.gdbinit`.

Add the following line to the file.

```bash
target extended-remote localhost:3333
```

A `~/.config/gdb/gdbinit` file in your home directory controls what other `.gdbinit` files are allowed to load on startup. 

Create file `~/.config/gdb/gdbinit` if it doesn't already exist, then add line

```bash
add-auto-load-safe-path </add/path/to/project/.gdbinit>
```

Substitute the project path with the actual path to projects `.gdbinit` file.

If you have several projects in different directories you can add a line for each of them. When you start `gdb-multiarch` while in a directory, if the master gdbinit file `~/.config/gdb/gdbinit` allows it, gdb will load and process a second .gdbinit file which is in the current working directory. Doing this you can have specific instructions on a per project basis.

### Adding a Makefile target to start openocd and gdb-multiarch together

This will start openocd, gdb-multiarch and connect gdb to the openocd target.

```Makefile
:debug
  openocd -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/interface/stlink.cfg -f /usr/share/openocd/scripts/target/stm32f4x.cfg & gdb-multiarch -q ./awesomesauce.elf -ex "target extended-remote localhost:3333"
```
`-f` is the file to load specific to the programmer/debugger and device

`&` is used to start another process for gdb-multiarch

gdb-multiarch arguments
`-q` = quiet mode
`-ex` = specify a command to run at start up

Run the `make` task with:

```bash
make debug
```

### kill openocd port 3333

```bash
kill $(lsof -t -i:3333)
```
